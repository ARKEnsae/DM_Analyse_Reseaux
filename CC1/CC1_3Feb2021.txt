# Load ELfriend
# Create graph; see its basic properties; view nodes; view edges; calculate in- and out-degrees; view the neighbors of one node of your choice; plot graph
# Replace two edges of your choice and re-do the above
# Remove three nodes of your choice and re-do the above


# Repeat the same exercice with ELcowork

## Careful: ELfriend is an asymmetric matrix (like ELadvice), while ELcowork is symmetric
